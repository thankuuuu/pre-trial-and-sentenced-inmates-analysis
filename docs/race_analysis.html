        <p>The portion bar chart revealed that even the population of white people is about 5 times of black people and the crime rate of white people is more than twice of black people, but the number of pre-trial white inmates is just nearly the same number as black inmates. However, the portion of pre-trail inmates and sentenced inmates after being pre-trail are insignificantly different which suggests that percent of being sentenced after pre-trail are likely to be the same regardless their race.</p> 
        <p>To clearly see how each race was detained pre-trail compare to the number of their crime. The radar chart above show the number of each race crime in 2018 per thousand of their own population and the number of each race pre-trial inmates held by the Department of Correction in 2018 per million of their own population. The number of Black and Hispanic that were detained pre-trial is quite a lot considering their committing crime, especially for Black people when compare to others race. In contrast, American Indian is the only race among this group that the number of pre-trial inmates per 1M population is less the number of crime per 1K population.</p>

        <p>Focusing on percent being sentenced after pre-trail, Asian has the lowest percent with about 12 percent, while others race percent being sentenced are above Asian inmates which are around 18%.</p> 
        <br></br>
        <h3>Sentenced Days and Bond Amount</h3>
        <p>Sentenced days is number of days to be imprison after being sentenced. On the other hand, bond amounts set financial conditions for pretrial release. The bond amount used to calculate the average here is the first day's bond amount as sometimes it can be changed during inmateâ€™s  pre-trial process. Let's see whether the average sentenced days and bond amount of each race are nearly the same level or not ?</p>

        <p>Both of average sentenced days and bond amount of Asian inmates are somewhat exceed the total average number and stay on the top among five race. On the other hand, inmates who identified as Black or Hispanic stay near the total average line while American Indian inmates seems to be sentenced with low sentence days, but with the second highest in term of bond amount among these groups. Notably, White inmates is the only race that was set financial conditions for pretrial release lower than the total average.</p>
